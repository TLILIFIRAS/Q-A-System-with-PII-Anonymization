# Question-answering system with PII anonymization

This project implements a document anonymization and query system that leverages the capabilities of LangChain and OpenAI's language models. The system is designed to anonymize sensitive information in documents, enabling secure and privacy-preserving querying.

## Features

- **Anonymization**: Sensitive information such as names, dates, and personal identifiers are anonymized using the Presidio framework.
- **Contextual Querying**: Users can ask questions based on anonymized documents, and the system retrieves relevant context while respecting privacy.
- **Integration with OpenAI**: The project uses OpenAI's language models to generate answers based on the provided context.
- **Flexible Architecture**: The system is built using LangChain, allowing for easy customization and extension.
